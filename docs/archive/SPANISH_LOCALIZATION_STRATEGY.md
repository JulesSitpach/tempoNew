# üåç Spanish Localization Strategy - SMB Tariff Suite

## üìã **Strategic Decision: Progressive Implementation**

Based on analysis of the current codebase and business priorities, the **recommended approach is to build i18n as features are developed** rather than doing it all at the end.

## üéØ **Why Progressive Implementation is Optimal**

### ‚úÖ **Current State Analysis**

- **Infrastructure**: i18next already configured and working
- **Foundation**: Basic translation files exist for both English and Spanish
- **Partial Integration**: Some components already use `useTranslation` hooks
- **Market Priority**: Mexican/LatAm market represents significant revenue opportunity

### üöÄ **Benefits of Progressive Approach**

1. **Quality Assurance**: Test localization early and often
2. **User Experience**: Better integration between UI and localization
3. **Development Efficiency**: Catch i18n issues during development, not after
4. **Market Readiness**: Launch Spanish version simultaneously with English
5. **Revenue Impact**: Don't delay LatAm market entry due to localization backlog

   t("products_affected_kpi");
   ```

2. **Pluralization**: Handle Spanish plural rules

   ```typescript
   t("products_count", { count: products.length });
   ```

3. **Number Formatting**: Mexican formatting (1,234.56 ‚Üí 1 234,56)
   ```typescript
   new Intl.NumberFormat("es-MX", {
     style: "currency",
     currency: "MXN",
   }).format(amount);
   ```
